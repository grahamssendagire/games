      //The first variable — randomNumber — is assigned a random number between 1 and 100, 
      //Calculated using a mathematical algorithm.
      // The first three constants are each made to store a reference to the results paragraphs in our HTML,
      // and are used to insert values into the paragraphs later on in the code (note how they are inside a <div> element, which is itself used to select all three later on for resetting, when we restart the game):
      // NUMBER ONE: Initiation
      //A random number between 1 and 100 is generated using Math.random(), which produces a floating-point number between 0 and 1. This value is multiplied by 100 and floored (rounded down to the nearest whole number) to get an integer between 0 and 99, and then 1 is added to get a range from 1 to 100.

      //guesses: Displays previous guesses.
      //lastResult: Displays the last guess result.
      //lowOrHi: Provides hints about the guess (too high or too low).
      //guessSubmit: The button the player clicks to submit their guess.
      //guessField: The input field where the player types their guess

      // Our final two variables store a guess count of 1 (used to keep track of how many guesses the player has had), 
      //and a reference to a reset button that doesn't exist yet (but will later).

      // saving the need to keep repeating code all the time. This is really useful. 
      //There are a number of ways to define functions, but for now we'll concentrate on one simple type. Here we have defined a function by using the keyword function, followed by a name, with parentheses put after it. After that, we put two curly braces ({ }).
      // Inside the curly braces goes all the code that we want to run whenever we call the function.
      // NUMBER FOUR: Converting from a user's guess to a number
      //Returning to our checkGuess() function,
      // I think it's safe to say that we don't want it to just spit out a placeholder message.
      // We want it to check whether a player's guess is correct or not, and respond appropriately.

      //At this point, replace your current checkGuess() function with this version instead:
      //This function is triggered when the player submits a guess.

      //NOTE: This number guessing game involves elements of user interaction, conditional logic, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript. Players are provided feedback on their guesses, and the game logic is structured to allow for a clean start when a game concludes.
